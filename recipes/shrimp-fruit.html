             <h2>Directions</h2>

             <ol>
                <li>Step 1</li>
                    
                <p>Heat 1 teaspoon of the vegetable oil in a wok over medium-high heat. <br>
                    Pour in the onions, and cook until just set; set aside. <br>
                    Increase the heat to high, and pour another 1 teaspoon of oil to the wok.<br>
                     Stir in the shrimp, and cook until the shrimp turn pink, 
                     and are no longer translucent in the center, about 3 minutes; set aside.</p>
                
                <li>Step 2</li>
                <p>Wipe out the wok, and heat the remaining teaspoon of oil over high heat. <br>
                    Stir in the ginger, and cook quickly for a few seconds until the ginger begins 
                    to turn golden brown. <br>
                    Stir in the onion and chile peppers; cook for a minute or <br>
                    two until the onions begin to soften
                     and turn brown around the edges. <br>
                    Add the pineapple and oranges, and gently cook until the pineapple is hot.</p>
                <li>step 3</li>
                <p>Stir in the rice, walnuts, and soy sauce. Stir for a few minutes until the rice is hot. 
                    Fold in the egg, shrimp, and cilantro. 
                    Season to taste with salt and pepper, and cook to reheat.</p>
